[patch.crates-io]
# freya-core 0.4.0-rc.10 (crates.io) uses `UnboundedReceiver::try_recv()` in
# `src/runner.rs`, but the underlying `futures_channel::mpsc::UnboundedReceiver`
# exposes `try_next()` (see futures-channel). We vendor + patch freya-core to
# keep `cargo run -p looprs-desktop` and `make all` green until upstream ships a
# fixed release.

# freya-testing 0.4.0-rc.10 has the same try_recv() issue
